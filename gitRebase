git rebase allows one to easily change a series of commits, modifying the history of the repository.
You can reorder, edit, or squash commits together.

git rebase is typically used to:
-Edit previous commit messages
-Combine multiple commits into one
-Delete or revert commits that are no longer necessary

e.g. rebase commits against a branch 
$ git rebase --interactive other_branch_name

# squash
squash allows you to combine two or more commits into a single commit.
A commit is squashed into the commit above it.
Git then allows you to write a new commit message describing both changes
